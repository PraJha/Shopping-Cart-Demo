# Project Title

A react app to demonstrate how shopping cart works.

## Description

I have tried to made a controlled react component to show the working of a shopping cart. You can add new items to cart, delete them and also add multiple items of same type. Accordingly the number of items in it changes and is shown at the top.

## Technology Used

It is a react app made using class components. For styling I have used Bootstrap.
